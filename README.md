I am a recent Computer Science graduate and a Full Stack developer. I have worked on several Full Stack projects such as a social media web app and a crowdfunding web platform. I have also contributed to open-source projects.

I am always looking for a simpler and more maintainable solution. Willing to tackle any challenge be it DevOps, Backend, or Frontend. Love to automate repeatable tasks. I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills to real world problems.
